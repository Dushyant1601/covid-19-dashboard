# covid-19-dashboard
My first project, titled "COVID-19 Data Dashboard", involved collecting, cleaning, and analyzing pandemic-related data. I created interactive visualizations that showcased trends in cases, recoveries, and deaths over time. I also incorporated slicers and filters to allow dynamic exploration of the data based on country or time period.
